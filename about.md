<h3>About Me</h3>

Welcome to my Portfolio!<br>
My name is VeebS, I've been working on discord bots for a few years now in my personal time. All my bots are extremely customized for whoever I made them for, things like
bots for Arma 3 units administrative automations, Rust bots with staff actions, ticketing, and generally everything else you could want, I can do. I have mainly worked in JS but have recently done a course in Py and have been developing my skills in that area as well. <br><br>

To this, I am also a Junior Pen Tester (ethical hacker), so I have a growing knowledge and understanding on Cyber Security, threats, malware, scriping and more. I am currently bulding my hacking group 'Whiteclaw Hacking Group' which will eventually become a BBH (bug bounty hunting) team for companies looking for the work, and anyone else that may need it to test their programs, sites andd applications.<br><br>

Thank you for giving me a look! I hope to help you in whatever way you need!
